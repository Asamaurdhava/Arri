> *Intelligent expense evaluation with real-time currency conversion and personalized financial guidance*

**Swift Student Challenge 2025 Submission**

A SwiftUI-based iOS application that provides intelligent expense assessment through category-based evaluation, real-time currency conversion, and personalized financial recommendations. Developed for Swift Student Challenge 2025 submission.

## üì± Application Overview

Arri transforms how users approach expense decisions by combining smart categorization, real-time exchange rates, and thoughtful financial guidance. The app evaluates expenses against category-specific thresholds and provides actionable recommendations to promote mindful spending habits.

## ‚ú® Core Features

- **Smart Expense Evaluation** - Category-based assessment with intelligent thresholds
- **Real-time Currency Conversion** - Live USD-to-INR exchange rate integration
- **Personalized Recommendations** - Tailored advice based on expense patterns
- **Glassmorphism UI** - Modern, translucent design elements throughout
- **Multi-category Support** - Food, Transportation, Entertainment, Utilities, Shopping, and Others
- **Investment Guidance** - Suggests alternatives for high-value expenses

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Architecture

### SwiftUI Framework Implementation
- **Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM)** - Clean separation of concerns
- **ObservableObject** - Reactive state management with `@Published` properties
- **Async/Await** - Modern concurrency for API calls
- **Custom ViewModifiers** - Reusable glassmorphism effects
- **NavigationLink** - Seamless view transitions

### Financial Intelligence System
```swift
// Core expense evaluation categories
Food, Transportation, Entertainment, Utilities, Shopping, Other

// Assessment types
.acceptable(String)     // Within reasonable spending range
.overpriced(String)     // Moderately high, suggests alternatives
.investForFuture(String) // Significantly high, recommends investment
```

### Real-time Data Integration
- **Exchange Rate API** - Live USD-to-INR conversion
- **URLSession** - Asynchronous network requests
- **JSON Parsing** - Dynamic rate updates
- **Error Handling** - Graceful fallback for network failures

## üé® User Interface Design

### Visual Design Elements
- **Angular Gradient Background** - Dynamic color transitions (Blue ‚Üí Purple ‚Üí Pink ‚Üí Orange)
- **Glassmorphism Effects** - Translucent cards with blur effects
- **SF Symbols Integration** - Native iOS iconography
- **Responsive Layout** - Adaptive design for various screen sizes

### User Experience Flow
1. **Expense Input** - Name, amount, category, and currency selection
2. **Smart Evaluation** - Real-time assessment against category thresholds
3. **Visual Feedback** - Color-coded results with actionable recommendations
4. **Navigation** - Smooth transitions between input and assessment views

```

## üöÄ Key Technical Highlights

### Modern Swift Features
- **@MainActor** - UI thread safety for view model operations
- **@StateObject** - Automatic view updates on state changes
- **@FocusState** - Keyboard management for text fields
- **Task/await** - Asynchronous programming patterns

### Financial Algorithm
```swift
// Dynamic threshold calculation
let adjustedThreshold = baseThreshold * conversionRate

// Three-tier assessment system
if amount < adjustedThreshold { .acceptable }
else if amount < (adjustedThreshold * 2) { .overpriced }
else { .investForFuture }
```

### API Integration
- **RESTful API consumption** for real-time exchange rates
- **Error-resilient networking** with fallback mechanisms
- **JSON data parsing** for dynamic rate updates
